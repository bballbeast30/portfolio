- An Android and iOS ecommerce app that gives every user their own "store", so they can sell their items and other users can "shop their store".

- This project is geared at people who want to sell off old clothes and those you don't have the means to run their own website due to cost.

- This app was built with the [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) SDK as the front end and [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) as the backend.
