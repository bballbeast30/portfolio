{{< figure src="/img/me.JPG" title="" >}}   
My name is Akhil Peddikuppa and I am currently a sophomore at the School for the Talented and Gifted in Dallas, Texas. I'm now 15 years old and intending to study medicine in the future.

My main areas of interest are **biology**, **chemistry**, **technology**, and **business**, and I have been self learning about these topics for use in my everyday life. Recently, I've been researching peer to peer networking and especially decentralized network protocols with technology like [IPFS or the InterPlanetary File System.](https://ipfs.io/) The main sport I play is basketball, and I'm a big fan of the NBA. Some of my other extracurriculars include [Quiz Bowl,](https://www.naqt.com/about/quiz-bowl.html) an academic competition testing general knowledge in which I am the science, history, geography, and mythology player on my team; [Debate,](https://www.dallasdebate.org/) which I compete in at the varsity level; and [Piano,](https://www.yamaha.com/us/yms/plano/) which I've been doing for 6 months.
