{{< figure src="/img/me.JPG" title="" >}}   
My name is Akhil Peddikuppa and I am currently a sophomore at the School for the Talented and Gifted in Dallas, Texas. I'm 15 years old and intending to study medicine in the future and incorporate my interest of technology with it.

I've always been interesting in creating my own things whether it be an app, videos, or music. Recently, I've been researching peer to peer networking and especially decentralized network protocols with technology like [IPFS or the InterPlanetary File System](https://ipfs.io/). I've also been researching blockchain and how bitcoin operates. The main sport I play is basketball, and I'm a big fan of the NBA. Some of my other extracurriculars include Quiz Bowl, an academic competition testing general knowledge, debate, which I compete in at the varsity level, and piano, which I've been doing for 6 months.

This website is meant to be a portfolio of my work and a place for me to document my thoughts.
