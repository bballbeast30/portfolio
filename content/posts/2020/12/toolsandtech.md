## A Walkthrough of What I Use...


### ☎️ Phone

My current phone is the iPhone 11 Pro Max. 

### 💻 Laptop

My laptop is the [2019 MacBook Pro](https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro-16/). The specs are an i9 Processor, 16 gigs of RAM, a terabyte of storage, and an AMD Radeon Pro 5500M graphics card.

### ⌨️ Keyboard

My keyboard is the [Royal Kludge RK61 Mechanical Keyboard](https://www.amazon.com/RK-ROYAL-KLUDGE-Ultra-Compact-Multi-Device/dp/B08D8WFFXC/ref=sr_1_15?dchild=1&keywords=royal+kludge+rk61+mechanical+keyboard&qid=1608661998&sr=8-15).


### 🎧 Headphones

The headphones I use are the original [AirPods](https://www.apple.com/airpods/) from Apple. I got a pair in 2018 as a birthday gift, and they've been pretty nice for listening and simply because of how easy they are to use.

Now onto the software...

### 🎥 Davinci Resolve 17

**DaVinci Resolve 17** is my video editor of choice because it is free and offers professional grade features such as color grading, motion tracking, and much more. [If you haven't seen my DaVinci Resolve article, here it is.](/posts/favoritefreevideoediting)

### 🔍 Brave

My browser of choice is the [Brave Browser](https://brave.com/). Brave comes with ad block built in and a clean UI. Brave is built on Chromium which means Chrome extensions will also work.

### VS Code
The IDE I use for app development and for making this website is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and the theme I use is the Dracula Theme.

### 🕵🏾‍♂️ Alfred

[Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) is a great tool for navigating MacOS. It is very similar to Spotlight, however, Alfred is a lot faster than Spotlight and has a lot more features.
