DaVinci Resolve 17 is a video editing software that is FREE, used by professionals and packs many features that make it a great alternative to Adobe's Creative Cloud or Apple's Final Cut.

## What is DaVinci Resolve?
If you take a look at the main video-editing softwares used by professionals, you're most likely going to see either Premiere Pro or Final Cut Pro X. Now to people who can't spend upwards of $40/month or $300, or for those who do not own an Apple machine, this may not be a viable option. Enter, DaVinci Resolve. DaVinci Resolve is an NLE, or non-linear editing software, designed by BlackMagicDesign, a company that makes cameras and other filming equipment. DaVinci Resolve 17, the most recent version, has a free form editing timeline, pro color grading features, tracking, Fusion (which can be used for animation and VFX), and Fairlight, which is for audio editing. All of this comes in the form of one app. It's great for beginner and freelance filmmakers.

## System Requirements
Another great thing about DaVinci is that it also happens to work a lot better on devices that have lower specs. My previous laptop had a dual core i7, 8 GB of RAM and an integrated GPU. For normal edits and transitions, the program worked fine. Only once I started getting into heavy animations and VFX that I experienced lagged, but that is considered to be normal as of course my machine wasn't that specced up. What I would recommend for you to have (if what you are editing is 1080p) at least a quad core CPU, at least 8 GB of RAM, and a graphics card with at least 2 GB of VRAM. For 4K, you might want to bump the spec up to at least a 6 core CPU, 16 GB of RAM, and a graphics card with at least 4 GB of VRAM.

## Studio Version Pricing and Download Link
If you want the Studio Version then it will be **$300**, however, you can do a lot without paying that money. BlackMagic also doesn't constantly ask you to upgrade.
