How does Quiz Bowl work? 
========================

This video is from the NAQT, which is an organization that provides Quiz
Bowl questions.

Questions are read by a **moderator** and players buzz in when they
think they know the answer.

"**Tossup**" questions are questions that are to be answered
individually, but once answered they lead to three "**bonus**" questions
which can be answered as a team collectively.

Each tossup question is worth 10 points and if answered within the
bolded section of the tossup question, the player is awarded an extra 5
points in addition to the 10 which is called a "**power**".

Each bonus question is worth 10 points.

When do we meet? {#282f702d-f4e1-4c0e-bc24-26bd2bdb80a2}
================

Due to coronavirus, we have been meeting online through **Discord** to
conduct practice on Mondays from 5 - 7 PM.

How can I practice? {#3e62d1b6-99e8-4cd6-bf30-b1052348452a}
===================

There is this website called [Protobowl](http://protobowl.com), which
many people in Quiz Bowl use to practice.

The NAQT has a game called [Buzzword](https://www.naqt.com/buzzword/),
which is an audio game you can play to improve your quiz bowl skills.
There are sample games in the link provided, and if you would like, you
can make an NAQT account to compete in some of their tournaments. The
sample games are very similar to how real quiz bowl games will be read,
so it would be good practice to try them or just to see how you feel
playing Quiz Bowl.

Another resource is [quizbowlpackets.com](http://quizbowlpackets.com),
which is website where many packets from prominent Quiz Bowl
institutions are posted so that you can practice with them.
