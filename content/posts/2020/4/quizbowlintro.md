How does Quiz Bowl work? 
========================

Quiz Bowl is unique in the sense that it is an academic competition in which you don't take a test for, but, instead, you buzz in to answer questions, which makes tournaments an enjoyable experience.

Here's how it works:

- Questions are read by a **moderator** and players buzz in when they
think they know the answer.

- "**Tossup**" questions are questions that are to be answered
individually, but once answered they lead to three "**bonus**" questions
which can be answered as a team collectively.

- Each tossup question is worth 10 points and if answered within the
bolded section of the tossup question, the player is awarded an extra 5
points in addition to the 10 which is called a "**power**".

- Each bonus question is worth 10 points.

How can I practice?
===================

Due to Quiz Bowl being a competition, people study and practice to increase their knowledge of a topic in order to win games. Studying or practicing is up to you, but your team will be counting on you to know your category, so it would be helpful if you practiced a bit.

There is this website called [Protobowl](http://protobowl.com), which
many people in Quiz Bowl use to practice.

The NAQT has a game called [Buzzword](https://www.naqt.com/buzzword/),
which is an audio game you can play to improve your quiz bowl skills.
There are sample games in the link provided, and if you would like, you
can make an NAQT account to compete in some of their tournaments. The
sample games are very similar to how real quiz bowl games will be read,
so it would be good practice to try them or just to see how you feel
playing Quiz Bowl.
