Almost all cars available fall in this category.\nLevel 1: Driver Assistance Level 1 is the lowest automation level in vehicles. An example of level one automation in a vehicle would be the adaptive cruise control or lane assist in more modern cars. Examples of cars that have these features are a Toyota Corolla or maybe a Nissan Sentra.\nLevel 2: Partial Automation In this level, the vehicles can control both the steering wheel and accelerating or decelerating. They aren’t considered self driving because humans still have to sit in the front seat and are able to take control of the car at any time. Most cars in the United States that are accessible by mainstream consumers do not have an automation level higher than this. Examples of this technology in cars would be Tesla’s Autopilot or Cadillac’s Super Cruise Systems.\nLevel 3: Conditional Automation Level 3 vehicles have environmental detection and can make informed decisions for themselves, such as accelerating past a slow moving vehicle. They are defined by being able to drive themselves, although only under ideal conditions and with some limitations. Not being able to operate in these ideal conditions is the barrier for cars in this level. Cars like these cannot be found in the US, but in Germany Audi’s A8L will have Level 3 capabilities with a feature called Traffic Jam Pilot.\n  Level 4: High Automation These vehicles can operate without human interaction except for entering a destination. Until legislation and infrastructure evolves, these vehicles can only operate within a certain area, which is usually an urban environment. The ability to operate in within a certain area is what keeps vehicles at Level 4. Most Level 4 vehicles are geared towards ride-sharing services, such as Waymo which has developed cars which level 4 capabilities.\n  Level 5: Full Automation Level 5 vehicles have full autonomous capabilities and can operate on their own. They likely will not have steering wheels or pedals for accelerating or braking. They will also be free from any geographic boundaries that Level 4 vehicles were constrained by and would be able to go anywhere and do anything an experienced human driver could do. There are no Level 5 vehicles available to the public as of right now, however testing is being done in several places around the world.\n",
