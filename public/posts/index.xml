      <description>What is Quiz Bowl?  Quiz Bowl is an academic competition in which two teams compete to answer questions from all areas of knowledge, including history, literature, science, fine arts, current events, pop culture, sports, and more.
   This video is from the NAQT, which is an organization that provides Quiz Bowl questions.  How does Quiz Bowl work? Quiz Bowl is unique in the sense that it is an academic competition in which you don&amp;rsquo;t take a test for, but, instead, you buzz in to answer questions, which makes tournaments an enjoyable experience.</description>

      <description>DaVinci Resolve 17 is a video editing software that is FREE, used by professionals and packs many features that make it a great alternative to Adobe&amp;rsquo;s Creative Cloud or Apple&amp;rsquo;s Final Cut.
What is DaVinci Resolve? If you take a look at the main video-editing softwares used by professionals, you&amp;rsquo;re most likely going to see either Premiere Pro or Final Cut Pro X. Now to people who can&amp;rsquo;t spend upwards of $40/month or $300, or for those who do not own an Apple machine, this may not be a viable option.</description>
