<p>This video is from the NAQT, which is an organization that provides Quiz
Bowl questions.</p>
<p>Questions are read by a <strong>moderator</strong> and players buzz in when they
think they know the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<strong>Tossup</strong>&rdquo; questions are questions that are to be answered
individually, but once answered they lead to three &ldquo;<strong>bonus</strong>&rdquo; questions
which can be answered as a team collectively.</p>
<p>Each tossup question is worth 10 points and if answered within the
bolded section of the tossup question, the player is awarded an extra 5
points in addition to the 10 which is called a &ldquo;<strong>power</strong>&rdquo;.</p>
