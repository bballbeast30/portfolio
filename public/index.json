Quiz Bowl is an academic competition in which two teams compete to answer questions from all areas of knowledge, including history, literature, science, fine arts, current events, pop culture, sports, and more.\n   This video is from the NAQT, which is an organization that provides Quiz Bowl questions.  How does Quiz Bowl work? Quiz Bowl is unique in the sense that it is an academic competition in which you don\u0026rsquo;t take a test for, but, instead, you buzz in to answer questions, which makes tournaments an enjoyable experience.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s how it works:\n  Questions are read by a moderator and players buzz in when they think they know the answer.\n  \u0026ldquo;Tossup\u0026rdquo; questions are questions that are to be answered individually, but once answered they lead to three \u0026ldquo;bonus\u0026rdquo; questions which can be answered as a team collectively.\n  Each tossup question is worth 10 points and if answered within the bolded section of the tossup question, the player is awarded an extra 5 points in addition to the 10 which is called a \u0026ldquo;power\u0026rdquo;.\n  Each bonus question is worth 10 points.\n   When do we meet? Due to COVID, we have been meeting online through Discord to conduct practice on Mondays from 5 - 7 PM.\n Here are some sample questions from each major category: History Monks in this country accidentally altered the dangerous confluence of three rivers when they built the Leshan Buddha. A tomb containing a mercury river and an army of (*) Terracotta soldiers honors this country\u0026rsquo;s emperor Qin Shi Huangdi, who began building this nation\u0026rsquo;s defense against the Huns.

Hugo is a free and open source static site generator used by many to create blogs or portfolio websites for themselves. I myself use Hugo for this portfolio/blog site.\nStep 1: Installation The easiest way to install Hugo is through Homebrew. I recommend installing Homebrew as it makes downloading apps a lot easier.\nTo install Homebrew, run the following command:\n/bin/bash -c \u0026quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\u0026quot; The script will explain what it will do and then pause before it does it.\nTo install Hugo through Homebrew run:\nbrew install hugo Step 2: Create a site You can create a new site using the command:\nhugo new site blog Running this command will create a new site under the name \u0026ldquo;blog\u0026rdquo;. The folder will likely generate in your main hard drive folder, so I would recommend to move the folder into one for all your Hugo sites.\nStep 3: Let\u0026rsquo;s Add a Theme The Hugo Marketplace features a numerous amounts of themes to use all of which are for free. In this tutorial, we will use the PaperMod theme by Aditya Telange, which I use for this site.\nTo download the theme, you need to download the theme from Github using these commands:\ncd blog git init git submodule add https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod.git themes/hugo-PaperMod Then, we need to add the theme to our config.toml file using the commands:\necho 'theme = \u0026quot;hugo-PaperMod\u0026quot;' \u0026gt;\u0026gt; config.toml Step 4: Add Content To create content in the Hugo website, we can run the command:\nhugo new posts/firstpost.md This will create a new folder called \u0026ldquo;posts\u0026rdquo; in the content folder with file name \u0026ldquo;firstpost.md\u0026rdquo;.\nIf you would not like to use command line instructions, you can simply just create a new folder under content and add a file, although I recommend using the command line as it can save a lot of time.\nThe new file will look a bit like:\n--- title: \u0026quot;firstpost\u0026quot; date: 2020-12-21T08:47:11+01:00 draft: true --- The title parameter will be the title of your blog post. For this template you can add a cover image by adding:\ncover: image: insert image URL here to the post data.\nStep 5: Starting the Server To start the Hugo server with drafts enabled use command:\nhugo server -D You will see the web server is available at http://localhost:1313/ . Click the link in the terminal to visit your site.\nStep 6: Theme Customization In order to customize this theme you can visit the config.toml file.\nThere you will see something like this:\nbaseURL = \u0026quot;https://example.org/\u0026quot; languageCode = \u0026quot;en-us\u0026quot; title = \u0026quot;My New Hugo Site\u0026quot; theme = \u0026quot;hugo-PaperMod\u0026quot; Here, you can change the title of your site, which depending on your theme will change different values.\nI will like the docs for this specific theme here .\nBelow you will see my config.toml file for this site to get an idea of what you can do:\nbaseURL = \u0026quot;/\u0026quot; languageCode = \u0026quot;en-us\u0026quot; title = \u0026quot;Akhil Peddikuppa\u0026quot; theme = \u0026quot;hugo-PaperMod\u0026quot; buildDrafts = false [params] env = \u0026quot;production\u0026quot; title = \u0026quot;Akhil Peddikuppa\u0026quot; author = \u0026quot;Akhil Peddikuppa\u0026quot; ShowReadingTime = true ShowShareButtons = false comments = false defaultTheme = \u0026quot;auto\u0026quot; disableThemeToggle = false [fuseOpts] isCaseSensitive = false shouldSort = true location = 0 distance = 1_000 threshold = 0.4 minMatchCharLength = 0 keys = [ \u0026quot;title\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;permalink\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;summary\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;content\u0026quot; ] [params.label] text = \u0026quot;Akhil Peddikuppa\u0026quot; icon = \u0026quot;/favicon.ico\u0026quot; [params.profileMode] enabled = false title = \u0026quot;Akhil Peddikuppa\u0026quot; subtitle = \u0026quot;High School Sophomore at the School For the Talented and Gifted\u0026quot; imageUrl = \u0026quot;https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/img_lights.jpg\u0026quot; imageWidth = 250 imageHeight = 250 [[params.profileMode.buttons]] name = \u0026quot;About Me\u0026quot; url = \u0026quot;about\u0026quot; [[params.profileMode.buttons]] name = \u0026quot;Projects\u0026quot; url = \u0026quot;Projects\u0026quot; [[params.profileMode.buttons]] name = \u0026quot;Resume\u0026quot; url = \u0026quot;Resume\u0026quot; [[params.profileMode.buttons]] name = \u0026quot;My Tech\u0026quot; url = \u0026quot;tech\u0026quot; [[params.profileMode.buttons]] name = \u0026quot;Posts\u0026quot; url = \u0026quot;posts\u0026quot; [params.homeInfoParams] Title = \u0026quot;Hi there 👋\u0026quot; Content = \u0026quot;My name is Akhil.

Almost all cars available fall in this category.\nLevel 1: Driver Assistance Level 1 is the lowest automation level in vehicles. An example of level one automation in a vehicle would be the adaptive cruise control or lane assist in more modern cars. Examples of cars that have these features are a Toyota Corolla or maybe a Nissan Sentra.\nLevel 2: Partial Automation In this level, the vehicles can control both the steering wheel and accelerating or decelerating. They aren\u0026rsquo;t considered self driving because humans still have to sit in the front seat and are able to take control of the car at any time. Most cars in the United States that are accessible by mainstream consumers do not have an automation level higher than this. Examples of this technology in cars would be Tesla\u0026rsquo;s Autopilot or Cadillac\u0026rsquo;s Super Cruise Systems.\nLevel 3: Conditional Automation Level 3 vehicles have environmental detection and can make informed decisions for themselves, such as accelerating past a slow moving vehicle. They are defined by being able to drive themselves, although only under ideal conditions and with some limitations. Not being able to operate in these ideal conditions is the barrier for cars in this level. Cars like these cannot be found in the US, but in Germany Audi\u0026rsquo;s A8L will have Level 3 capabilities with a feature called Traffic Jam Pilot.\n  Level 4: High Automation These vehicles can operate without human interaction except for entering a destination. Until legislation and infrastructure evolves, these vehicles can only operate within a certain area, which is usually an urban environment. The ability to operate in within a certain area is what keeps vehicles at Level 4. Most Level 4 vehicles are geared towards ride-sharing services, such as Waymo which has developed cars which level 4 capabilities.\n  And Finally, Level 5: Full Automation Level 5 vehicles have full autonomous capabilities and can operate on their own. They likely will not have steering wheels or pedals for accelerating or braking. They will also be free from any geographic boundaries that Level 4 vehicles were constrained by and would be able to go anywhere and do anything an experienced human driver could do. There are no Level 5 vehicles available to the public as of right now, however testing is being done in several places around the world.\n","permalink":"/posts/2020/5/levelsofvehicleautomation/","summary":"With automation and especially automation in cars becoming more present in everyday life, it is important to know the concepts associated with the new technology that will one day be all around us.\nHere are the levels of vehicle automation in 3 minutes.\nLevel 0: No Automation These vehicles are the normal everyday cars that are manually controlled and ones that you most likely own.

If you take a look at the main video-editing softwares used by professionals, you\u0026rsquo;re most likely going to see either Premiere Pro or Final Cut Pro X. Now to people who can\u0026rsquo;t spend upwards of $40/month or $300, or for those who do not own an Apple machine, this may not be a viable option. Enter, DaVinci Resolve. DaVinci Resolve is an NLE, or non-linear editing software, designed by BlackMagicDesign, a company that makes cameras and other filming equipment. DaVinci Resolve 17, the most recent version, has a free form editing timeline, pro color grading features, tracking, Fusion (which can be used for animation and VFX), and Fairlight, which is for audio editing. All of this comes in the form of one app. It\u0026rsquo;s great for beginner and freelance filmmakers.\nSystem Requirements Another great thing about DaVinci is that it also happens to work a lot better on devices that have lower specs. My previous laptop had a dual core i7, 8 GB of RAM and an integrated GPU. For normal edits and transitions, the program worked fine. Only once I started getting into heavy animations and VFX that I experienced lagged, but that is considered to be normal as of course my machine wasn\u0026rsquo;t that specced up. What I would recommend for you to have (if what you are editing is 1080p) at least a quad core CPU, at least 8 GB of RAM, and a graphics card with at least 2 GB of VRAM. For 4K, you might want to bump the spec up to at least a 6 core CPU, 16 GB of RAM, and a graphics card with at least 4 GB of VRAM.\nStudio Version Pricing and Download Link If you want the Studio Version then it will be $300, however, you can do a lot without paying that money. BlackMagic also doesn\u0026rsquo;t constantly ask you to upgrade.
