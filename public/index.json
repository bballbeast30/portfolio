Almost all cars available fall in this category.\nLevel 1: Driver Assistance Level 1 is the lowest automation level in vehicles. An example of level one automation in a vehicle would be the adaptive cruise control or lane assist in more modern cars. Examples of cars that have these features are a Toyota Corolla or maybe a Nissan Sentra.\nLevel 2: Partial Automation In this level, the vehicles can control both the steering wheel and accelerating or decelerating. They aren\u0026rsquo;t considered self driving because humans still have to sit in the front seat and are able to take control of the car at any time. Most cars in the United States that are accessible by mainstream consumers do not have an automation level higher than this. Examples of this technology in cars would be Tesla\u0026rsquo;s Autopilot or Cadillac\u0026rsquo;s Super Cruise Systems.\nLevel 3: Conditional Automation Level 3 vehicles have environmental detection and can make informed decisions for themselves, such as accelerating past a slow moving vehicle. They are defined by being able to drive themselves, although only under ideal conditions and with some limitations. Not being able to operate in these ideal conditions is the barrier for cars in this level. Cars like these cannot be found in the US, but in Germany Audi\u0026rsquo;s A8L will have Level 3 capabilities with a feature called Traffic Jam Pilot.\n  Level 4: High Automation These vehicles can operate without human interaction except for entering a destination. Until legislation and infrastructure evolves, these vehicles can only operate within a certain area, which is usually an urban environment. The ability to operate in within a certain area is what keeps vehicles at Level 4. Most Level 4 vehicles are geared towards ride-sharing services, such as Waymo which has developed cars which level 4 capabilities.\n  And Finally, Level 5: Full Automation Level 5 vehicles have full autonomous capabilities and can operate on their own. They likely will not have steering wheels or pedals for accelerating or braking. They will also be free from any geographic boundaries that Level 4 vehicles were constrained by and would be able to go anywhere and do anything an experienced human driver could do. There are no Level 5 vehicles available to the public as of right now, however testing is being done in several places around the world.\n","permalink":"/posts/2020/5/levelsofvehicleautomation/","summary":"With automation and especially automation in cars becoming more present in everyday life, it is important to know the concepts associated with the new technology that will one day be all around us.\nHere are the levels of vehicle automation in 3 minutes.\nLevel 0: No Automation These vehicles are the normal everyday cars that are manually controlled and ones that you most likely own.

Hugo is a free and open source static site generator used by many to create blogs or portfolio websites for themselves. I myself use Hugo for this portfolio/blog site.\nStep 1: Installation The easiest way to install Hugo is through Homebrew. I recommend installing Homebrew as it makes downloading apps a lot easier.\nTo install Homebrew, run the following command:\n/bin/bash -c \u0026quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\u0026quot; The script will explain what it will do and then pause before it does it.\nTo install Hugo through Homebrew run:\nbrew install hugo Step 2: Create a site You can create a new site using the command:\nhugo new site blog Running this command will create a new site under the name \u0026ldquo;blog\u0026rdquo;. The folder will likely generate in your main hard drive folder, so I would recommend to move the folder into one for all your Hugo sites.\nStep 3: Let\u0026rsquo;s Add a Theme The Hugo Marketplace features a numerous amounts of themes to use all of which are for free. In this tutorial, we will use the PaperMod theme by Aditya Telange, which I use for this site.\nTo download the theme, you need to download the theme from Github using these commands:\ncd blog git init git submodule add https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod.git themes/hugo-PaperMod Then, we need to add the theme to our config.toml file using the commands:\necho 'theme = \u0026quot;hugo-PaperMod\u0026quot;' \u0026gt;\u0026gt; config.toml Step 4: Add Content To create content in the Hugo website, we can run the command:\nhugo new posts/firstpost.md This will create a new folder called \u0026ldquo;posts\u0026rdquo; in the content folder with file name \u0026ldquo;firstpost.md\u0026rdquo;.\nIf you would not like to use command line instructions, you can simply just create a new folder under content and add a file, although I recommend using the command line as it can save a lot of time.\nThe new file will look a bit like:\n--- title: \u0026quot;firstpost\u0026quot; date: 2020-12-21T08:47:11+01:00 draft: true --- The title parameter will be the title of your blog post. For this template you can add a cover image by adding:\ncover: image: (insert image URL here) to the post data.\nStep 5: Starting the Server To start the Hugo server with drafts enabled use command:\nhugo server -D You will see the web server is available at http://localhost:1313/. Click the link in the terminal to visit your site.\nStep 6: Theme Customization In order to customize this theme you can visit the config.toml file.\nThere you will see something like this:\nbaseURL = \u0026quot;https://example.org/\u0026quot; languageCode = \u0026quot;en-us\u0026quot; title = \u0026quot;My New Hugo Site\u0026quot; theme = \u0026quot;hugo-PaperMod\u0026quot; Here, you can change the title of your site, which depending on your theme will change different values.\nI will like the docs for this specific theme here.\nBelow you will see my config.toml file for this site to get an idea of what you can do:\nbaseURL = \u0026quot;/\u0026quot; languageCode = \u0026quot;en-us\u0026quot; title = \u0026quot;Akhil Peddikuppa\u0026quot; theme = \u0026quot;hugo-PaperMod\u0026quot; buildDrafts = false [params] env = \u0026quot;production\u0026quot; title = \u0026quot;Akhil Peddikuppa\u0026quot; author = \u0026quot;Akhil Peddikuppa\u0026quot; ShowReadingTime = true ShowShareButtons = false comments = false defaultTheme = \u0026quot;auto\u0026quot; disableThemeToggle = false [fuseOpts] isCaseSensitive = false shouldSort = true location = 0 distance = 1_000 threshold = 0.4 minMatchCharLength = 0 keys = [ \u0026quot;title\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;permalink\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;summary\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;content\u0026quot; ] [params.label] text = \u0026quot;Akhil Peddikuppa\u0026quot; icon = \u0026quot;/favicon.ico\u0026quot; [params.profileMode] enabled = false title = \u0026quot;Akhil Peddikuppa\u0026quot; subtitle = \u0026quot;High School Sophomore at the School For the Talented and Gifted\u0026quot; imageUrl = \u0026quot;https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/img_lights.jpg\u0026quot; imageWidth = 250 imageHeight = 250 [[params.profileMode.buttons]] name = \u0026quot;About Me\u0026quot; url = \u0026quot;about\u0026quot; [[params.profileMode.buttons]] name = \u0026quot;Projects\u0026quot; url = \u0026quot;Projects\u0026quot; [[params.profileMode.buttons]] name = \u0026quot;Resume\u0026quot; url = \u0026quot;Resume\u0026quot; [[params.profileMode.buttons]] name = \u0026quot;My Tech\u0026quot; url = \u0026quot;tech\u0026quot; [[params.profileMode.buttons]] name = \u0026quot;Posts\u0026quot; url = \u0026quot;posts\u0026quot; [params.homeInfoParams] Title = \u0026quot;Hi there 👋\u0026quot; Content = \u0026quot;My name is Akhil.

If you take a look at the main video-editing softwares used by professionals, you\u0026rsquo;re most likely going to see either Premiere Pro or Final Cut Pro X. Now to people who can\u0026rsquo;t spend upwards of $40/month or $300, or for those who do not own an Apple machine, this may not be a viable option. Enter, DaVinci Resolve. DaVinci Resolve is an NLE, or non-linear editing software, designed by BlackMagicDesign, a company that makes cameras and other filming equipment. DaVinci Resolve 17, the most recent version, has a free form editing timeline, pro color grading features, tracking, Fusion (which can be used for animation and VFX), and Fairlight, which is for audio editing. All of this comes in the form of one app. It\u0026rsquo;s great for beginner and freelance filmmakers.\nSystem Requirements Another great thing about DaVinci is that it also happens to work a lot better on devices that have lower specs. My previous laptop had a dual core i7, 8 GB of RAM and an integrated GPU. For normal edits and transitions, the program worked fine. Only once I started getting into heavy animations and VFX that I experienced lagged, but that is considered to be normal as of course my machine wasn\u0026rsquo;t that specced up. What I would recommend for you to have (if what you are editing is 1080p) at least a quad core CPU, at least 8 GB of RAM, and a graphics card with at least 2 GB of VRAM. For 4K, you might want to bump the spec up to at least a 6 core CPU, 16 GB of RAM, and a graphics card with at least 4 GB of VRAM.\nStudio Version Pricing and Download Link If you want the Studio Version then it will be $300, however, you can do a lot without paying that money.

This essay won third place in that competition.\n Many in the United States have been yearning for a reform in the criminal justice system citing issues such as racism, prevalence of junk methods in forensic science, and harsh, strict sentencing for drug cases. Proponents of criminal justice reform have proposed a plan that states:\n The United States federal government should enact substantial criminal justice reform in the United States in one or more of the following areas: forensic science, policing, sentencing.\n This plan is unnecessary largely because many of the points and examples that have been made are very faulty and contain generalizations that are not supported by evidence. Over the past few decades, these systems have progressively become more effective and less faulty and has reformed itself over time.\nRacism has been an issue that many criminal justice reformists have brought up, claiming the criminal justice system is racist. Although racism may be present in other parts of the country, the criminal justice system does not have biases against any race. Advocates often cite that 56% of the correctional population in the United States is either Hispanic or Black. The NAACP states that blacks are incarcerated at 5 times the rate that white people are. At first glance, this would appear as a clear example of racism; however, we must take a dive into what really causes this disparity in incarceration rates between whites and blacks and Hispanics. First, we must start at the root of the problem. US Census data in 2010 revealed that there were more black households with single mothers than households with two parents. This type of family structure puts much financial and social stress on not only the mother, but also the kids involved. According to a Cornell study published in 2009, children in single parent households were more likely to have increased likelihood of dropping out of school, poor grades, smoking, binge drinking, and marijuana use. These combined outcomes contribute to the high incarceration rates of young black teenagers, along with the prevalence of gangs in poverty-stricken areas.\nMany black and Hispanic teens are jailed due to marijuana possession, because as we stated, children under single parent households tend to have higher chances of marijuana consumption than the average child with two parents. Poor grades tend to lead these teens not to have an interest in their educational attainment and this leads to them joining gangs and deviating to unhealthy habits. Aside from these indirect impacts, there is a direct impact of the health concerns caused by the use of marijuana. Marijuana is what is known as a gateway drug, meaning it is usually a drug used before people move on to more potent substances, such as heroin. THC levels in marijuana have been increasing over time. Weed smoked in the 60’s and 70’s had a THC level of about 1%. Nowadays, weed is sold with over 11 times previous levels of THC concentration. Marijuana legalization is argued by CJR activists because of the so-called numerous number of people in jail for small time marijuana use, however, according to Dr. Kevin Sabet, 0.3% of all state inmates were behind bars for marijuana possession only. Marijuana also has a big impact on teens. When Colorado legalized marijuana use in 2014, the usage among teenagers increased by over 50% the national average over 5 years. Drug related referrals for high school students testing positive for marijuana use increased. Evidence also points to marijuana’s correlation with mental illnesses such as psychosis and schizophrenia. Kids who begin using marijuana may have reduced IQs when compared to young people who do not use it. The legalization of this drug would not decrease the nation\u0026rsquo;s youth accessibility to marijuana. According to data from a 2012 study by the National Survey of America Attitudes on Substance Abuse, 44% of teens reported that they were able to get access to cigarettes within a day, as opposed to 45% saying they would be unable to procure marijuana in that same time span. Legalization of marijuana, similar to how cigarettes and tobacco are already legal, would lead to increased consumption of the substance by the youth population. The legalization of the drug would not lower incarceration rates, but would increase the amount of people that would end up being charged with offences that otherwise would not have occured.\nAnother issue brought to surface by reform activists is the issue of harsh sentencing and capital punishment. Many state that the strict sentencing by the courts of criminals is unnecessary and extensive. Instead, they claim rehabilitation procedures are more likely to fix criminals as opposed to punishment derived from the severity of their crime. If current sentencing measures are not functional, then why have, according to the FBI and Pew Research Center, crimes rates decreased 54% over the span of 25 years even while sentences have been carried out at the same level with little reform? The truth of the matter is that the stern sentencing has led to a decrease in the crime, so the belief that by releasing more of these offenders or having less relaxed measures will lead to a more just legal system is simply implausible. With more people committing crimes off the street, people are less likely to find others that commit the same crime and band together.\nAnother area of reform presented by the plan is in the area of forensic science. Many of the cases introduced by supporters of criminal justice reform use cases in which the conviction was given in the early 90’s. Rarely do proponents provide cases that have occurred in recent time. Over time, forensic scientists have improved their methodology and the technology they use to examine crime scenes. More accurate DNA analysis and preservation over the years has led to decrease in falsehoods in cases. A national automated fingerprint identification system has been in place, and this has reduced the amount of cases that have investigator bias when examining fingerprints. This widespread national database was not available back in the 90’s, so the bias in the examination of the fingerprints would have been higher. According to the National Justice Institute, scientists have developed new standards for examining broken glass fragments and methods that increase the consistency of their findings. These advancements, along with the numerous advancements in the availability and price of new technology has led to the decrease in the use of junk science in modern cases that was used in the past.\nThe plan provided does not attack the root of the problem, instead it attempts to fix a system that is doing what it was intended to do. The real solution to a reduction in mass incarceration would be to focus on the main issue of why many people become criminals, poverty. As we stated in previous paragraphs, many teens, especially those with single parent households, tend to deviate towards illegal activities due to their lower socioeconomic standpoint. They become trapped in a cycle of poverty and may try to make ends meet by trafficking some of these drugs, which is mainly what most marijuana arrests are from, drug trafficking, as opposed to just possession. The health effects of the consumption of marijuana range anywhere from mental illnesses to lower IQ levels, especially in young adults. The legalization would lead to an increase in the availability of marijuana, which will eventually reach the hands of the teens of the nation as we have stated in previous paragraphs. The only true solution would be to address the poverty stricken areas in the United States and implement incentives that would lead to a reduction in the amount of single parent households, in turn leading to less incarceration rates within the population and higher educational attainment for the average American as there are less people going to jail.\nWorks Cited: Nicosia, Chloe. “The Legalization of Marijuana and the Negative Impact.” WhiteSandsTreatment, whitesandstreatment.com/addiction-articles/legalization-marijuana-negative-impact/.\n“Households and Families.” Social Trends, vol. 40, no. 1, 2010, pp. 13–26., doi:10.1057/st.2010.6.\n“40 Facts About Two Parent Families: Studies and Statistics.” GillespieShields, 28 Feb. 2020, gillespieshields.com/40-facts-two-parent-families/.\nGramlich, John. “5 Facts about Crime in the U.S.” Pew Research Center, Pew Research Center, 17 Oct. 2019, www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/10/17/facts-about-crime-in-the-u-s/.\nMusick, Kelly. “Are Both Parents Always Better Than One?
